## Shroomtoshi's gift

Shroomtoshi graciously left some gifts behind before going full Satoshi. He asked his custodians (dazza9, Kenny, richwake) to deliver Shrooms #85 (Number Go Up) and #86 (HODL) to 25 people he named. He proposed distributing the gifts in 10/15 multisig wallets. NGU never touched the multisig, the group asked the custodians to list the shroom for sale and distribute the proceeds between members. NGU sold for 1.6 BTC on 30 May 2024. 

The 13 members of the HODL group voted to honor Shroomtoshi's wish and set up the multisig. 

## Why 8/13?

Partly it's a trade-off between risk of loss vs risk of theft. The higher the threshold, the easier it is to lose access to the shroom. In a 11/13 multisig three people lose their keys and it's game over. With lower thresholds it's easier for an attacker to steal the shroom. In a 4/13 multisig, an attacker only needs to hack 4 members. 

The main consideration, though, is how many people need to agree to make decisions. If the threshold is lower than 50%, a minority of the holders can act against the wishes of the majority, so let's not do that. A simple majority (7/13) can make decisions faster but might leave a relatively large minority unhappy. If we require a super-majority of the group to agree (eg. 10/13), a relatively small minority can block decisions that would make most people happy.

### Collusion

The kind of majority decision that would make minority holders very unhappy, is if a majority of holders collude against the others to lock them out. In a 3/13 multisig it would only take three people to go behind the other's back and send the shroom out to their own 3/3. That's an easy 4x. With an 8/13 multisig, though, you need secret coordination between 8 members which sounds pretty hard. Also the upside is lower because.
